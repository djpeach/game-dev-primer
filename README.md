# What is this repo?

This repo is a collection of simple games and scripts written in various programming languages. At first it will be just 
python with [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and C++ with [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML). I plan to add Javascript
with HTML canvas, but I will focus on python and C++ bc that is what 230 and 240 students need to learn.

# Why should I build games?

Games are a fun, although sometimes challenging, way to learn a language. For example, C++ is a language I has a particular disdain 
for, even though I knew about its power and performance. I simply did not want to learn it. Enter game dev with SFML, and I suddenly 
love C++ and actaully learned more than I ever thought I would. Pointers, casting, r and l values, are no longer scary or things to 
avoid, but things I use all the time while building games. 

So if you too want to learn a language and want to do it by building something you will be able to see, use, and share, I encourage 
you to give game dev a try!

# What are we building?

You can build anything, but I will build a little space-explorer game to showcase a lot of concepts:

We start really simple and add features as we go!

# Where do I get started?

Now you're asking the right questions! There are many many many resources online for learning game dev with both these libraries. 
I plan on adding a full wiki of resources here in the future but for now, I will just list a few topics to start with in both language.
